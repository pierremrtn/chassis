# Welcome to Chassis

> **Rigid in Structure, Flexible in Implementation.**

## Overview

Chassis is an opinionated architectural framework for Flutter that provides a solid foundation for professional, scalable, and maintainable applications. It guides your project's structure by combining the clarity of **MVVM** with a pragmatic, front-end friendly implementation of **CQRS** principles.

Think of it like the chassis of a car: it provides a rigid, reliable frame so you can focus on building the features that make your application unique. üèéÔ∏è

## The Philosophy: Structure by Design

Good architecture shouldn't rely on developer discipline alone. Chassis is designed around a few core principles to make best practices the path of least resistance.

  * üèõÔ∏è **Structure by Design:** Chassis enforces a clear separation of concerns through its defined data flow. This makes it intuitive to write clean, organized code that is easy for anyone on the team to navigate.
  * üß© **Rigid Structure, Flexible Logic:** The overall flow of data is consistent and predictable. However, your actual business logic within each component remains isolated, flexible, and easy to change.
  * ‚úÖ **Testability First:** Every layer, from ViewModels to business logic Handlers, is decoupled by design, making it simple to mock dependencies and test any part of your application in isolation.
  * üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Experience Focused:** We aim for minimal boilerplate and a clean, intuitive API. The goal is to make building on a solid architecture feel productive, not restrictive.

## Core Concepts

Chassis is built around the **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** pattern, adjusted for front-end development needs. Fundamentally, this means separating the act of writing data from reading data.

  * **Writes (Commands):** Any operation that mutates domain state (as opposed to view state) is a **Command**. Commands are objects representing an intent to change something (e.g., `CreateUserCommand`). They are processed by a single handler containing all the necessary business logic and validation, which ensures data consistency and integrity.
  * **Reads (Queries):** All data retrieval is done through **Queries**. A query asks for information and returns a domain object but is strictly forbidden from changing state.

These messages are routed through a central **Mediator**, which decouples the sender from the handler. This design provides a clear separation of concerns, enhances scalability, and simplifies complex business domains.

#### The Flow of Action (Commands) üé¨

When you need to change the application's state, you send a `Command`.

```
ViewModel ‚û°Ô∏è Command ‚û°Ô∏è Mediator ‚û°Ô∏è Handler ‚û°Ô∏è Data Layer
```

#### The Flow of Data (Queries) üìä

When you need to read or subscribe to data, you send a `Query`.

```
ViewModel ‚û°Ô∏è Query ‚û°Ô∏è Mediator ‚û°Ô∏è Handler ‚û°Ô∏è Data Layer ‚û°Ô∏è Returns Data
```

## Core Components

Chassis is composed of two packages that work together: a core architectural library and a Flutter presentation layer.

### **`chassis`**: The Core Architectural Layer

A pure Dart package providing the foundational pieces for your application's business logic, completely independent of the UI.

  * **Mediator**: The central router that decouples your UI from your business logic.
  * **Messages**: Immutable classes that represent your use cases (`Command`, `ReadQuery`, `WatchQuery`).
  * **Handlers**: Classes where your business logic lives. Each handler is responsible for a single message.

### **`chassis_flutter`**: The Presentation Layer

This package seamlessly connects your core logic to the Flutter widget tree.

  * **ViewModel**: The base class for your presentation logic, holding UI state and dispatching messages.
  * **ViewModelProvider**: A widget that uses `provider` to inject your `ViewModel` into the widget tree.
  * **ConsumerMixin**: A mixin for handling one-time events from the `ViewModel` (like showing a dialog).

## Chassis vs. State Management

The Flutter ecosystem has excellent state management libraries like **BLoC** and **Riverpod**. **Chassis is not a replacement for them‚Äîit operates at a different level of abstraction.**

BLoC and Riverpod are primarily **tools for state management**. Chassis is an **opinionated framework for application architecture** that uses those tools as part of its foundation.

| Aspect                | BLoC / Riverpod                                                  | Chassis                                                                |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Goal** | Efficiently manage state and rebuild the UI when it changes.     | Enforce a consistent, scalable, and decoupled application structure.           |
| **Where Logic Lives** | **Flexible.** Logic can live in a `Bloc`, service, or repository. | **Prescriptive.** Business logic **must** live in dedicated `Handler` classes. |
| **Architectural Style** | **High Freedom.** Provides powerful primitives to design your own structure. | **Low Freedom.** Provides a strict structure in exchange for consistency.        |

### When to Choose Chassis

Chassis is designed for scenarios where architectural consistency and scalability are the highest priorities:

  * You are building a **large, complex application**.
  * **Consistency across a large team** is critical.
  * A **strict separation of concerns** is a project requirement.

**The Trade-off:** There is more upfront boilerplate for simple features. This "ceremony" is the price for long-term scalability and maintainability.
